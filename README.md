Black Hole Recoil Effects

This repository contains the codes developed for the paper:
“Gravitational Wave Recoil Effects on Early SMBH Growth and Retention” (Bisweswar Sen, IISER Pune, 2025)

Overview

The codes here implement:

Spin assignment algorithms for black hole seeds (Pop III remnants, cluster collisions, and direct collapse).

Gravitational-wave recoil velocity calculations using numerical relativity fitting formulae.

Retention probability frameworks comparing recoil velocities with halo escape speeds.

Enhanced merger treatments including wandering and ejected black hole populations.

These tools are designed for researchers studying supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in the early Universe and the astrophysical consequences of gravitational-wave recoil.

Usage

The repository provides Python implementations that can be integrated into semi-analytic SMBH formation models or used for standalone exploration.

See the individual scripts and function docstrings for details.

Example workflows are provided for calculating recoil velocities, retention probabilities, and SMBH growth histories.
